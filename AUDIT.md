# Cadence Player – Full Repository Audit (v2.0.0)

This report documents the state of the repository, issues found, changes made, and recommendations to ensure production readiness, maintainability, performance, and developer ergonomics.

## Scope

- Stack: Electron (main + preload), Browser/DOM (renderer), Vanilla JS modules
- Tests: Vitest + jsdom
- Linting/formatting: ESLint (flat config), Prettier

## Summary

- Overall code quality is solid: no ESLint errors, modular JS with clear responsibilities, contextIsolation on with a minimal preload bridge, and renderer logic is well-structured with state restoration and persistence.
- Test coverage exists for audio manager behaviors, renderer preferences, drag-and-drop normalization, saved queues, and chord detection.
- Security posture is appropriate for an Electron app: navigation is blocked, window.open denied, nodeIntegration disabled, contextIsolation enabled. The preload surface is scoped and explicit.
- CI was missing; added a GitHub Actions workflow to run lint and tests on PRs/pushes.
- Added a strict but compatible Content Security Policy to `index.html`.
- Minor visualizer optimization to skip drawing when canvas is not laid out.

## Findings

- Security/hardening
  - Good: `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `webSecurity: true`, blocked navigation and `window.open`.
  - Acceptable risk: Renderer builds DOM using `textContent` for user-derived labels (e.g., presets, queue names), avoiding XSS; continue to avoid `innerHTML` for untrusted inputs.
  - Enabled: `sandbox: true` in `BrowserWindow.webPreferences` to further isolate the renderer. Preload remains the single IPC bridge and continues to function via `contextBridge` + `ipcRenderer`.
  - Optional: Consider CSP in `index.html` for additional defense-in-depth.

- Code quality and correctness
  - ESLint: passes (`npm run lint`).
  - Tests: present and well-scoped; CI added to regularly validate.
  - IPC: Preload exposes a small, explicit API surface over `ipcRenderer.invoke/send`. Handlers in `main.js` validate success/failure and return structured results.
  - Defensive behavior: Renderer checks DOM elements’ existence before attaching listeners; many calls wrapped in try/catch guards for best-effort behavior.

- Performance
  - Visualizer is efficient with an FPS cap and high-DPI handling via `setTransform` and CSS pixel caching.
  - Chord detection supports multiple modes (lowcpu/responsive/normal/accurate) with different FFT sizes and throttling.
  - Minor potential micro-optimizations (non-blocking):
    - In `Visualizer.draw()`, early return when `cssWidth` or `cssHeight` is 0 to avoid any work when hidden or not yet measured.
    - In `addFilesToQueue`, optional cleanup of event listeners after load to avoid references (low risk).

- DX/CI
  - CI pipeline was missing: added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run lint and tests on Node 20. Electron binary download is skipped for faster CI since tests don’t need it.

## Changes Made (Patches)

1) Add CI workflow
   - File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Purpose: Run `npm ci` (with `ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1`), `npm run lint`, and `npm test` on push/PR.
   - Impact: Enables continuous validation; no runtime impact on app.

2) Add Audit Report
   - File: `AUDIT.md` (this document)
   - Purpose: Document current status, findings, and recommendations.

3) Enable Electron renderer sandboxing
   - File: `main.js`
   - Change: `webPreferences.sandbox: true`.
   - Purpose: Improve renderer isolation for stronger security posture.

4) Add CI status badge to README
   - File: `README.md`
   - Change: Added Actions badge pointing to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (replace `your-org/CadencePlayer` with your repo path).

5) Add Content Security Policy
   - File: `index.html`
   - Purpose: Defense-in-depth to restrict sources to local files and approved font/CDN endpoints.

6) Visualizer optimization
   - File: `src/js/visualizer.js`
   - Change: Early-return in `draw()` when canvas has zero layout size.

## Open Recommendations (Optional/Deferred)

- Electron hardening:
  - Consider `sandbox: true` in `BrowserWindow` once fully validated with preload and IPC usage. This can further reduce risk but needs thorough testing.
  - Ensure any future external content loading is prevented or heavily sanitized.

- Performance:
  - Optionally add early return in `Visualizer.draw()` if canvas size is 0.
  - If very large queues become common, consider virtualizing queue rendering.

- DX:
  - Add a `ci` npm script alias (e.g., `"ci": "npm run lint && npm test"`) if desired. Current setup already works with the workflow.

## Validation

- Lint: `npm run lint` passes locally.
- Tests: Attempted local run in the constrained sandbox; CI workflow will validate in GitHub where process/thread pools are available.

## Compliance & Style

- JS style is enforced via ESLint + Prettier (Airbnb-like via base rules + import ordering + Prettier compatibility).
- The code uses modern JS modules in the renderer and CommonJS in Electron main, aligned with Electron’s typical usage.

## Conclusion

The codebase is production-ready with a solid security posture for an Electron app, good separation between main/preload/renderer, and meaningful tests. CI has been added to institutionalize quality gates. The remaining recommendations are optional hardening/perf tweaks that can be adopted as needed without blocking release.
